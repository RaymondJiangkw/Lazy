* NOTICE: One of `source` and `auto` must be specified. When they are both given, `source` will be used.

## Feature
* Support `.epub` output format.
* Asynchronize I/O operations to prevent `cache` mechanism from influencing performance.
* Realize *Auto-Detection* of catalogs to save labor and *Merging* of catalogs to generate better content.

## Acknowledge
* `Bing`: used to search catalogs of novel.
* `bmaupin/go-epub`: used to generate `.epub` file.
* `mvdan/xurls`: used to delete `url` from text.
* `cheggaaa/pb`: used to generate multiple progress bars.
* `andybalholm/cascadia`: used to extract tags based on CSS Selector.
* `cj1128/myers-diff`: used to integrate catalogs provided by different websites.
* [Ans in Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53666867/after-called-peek-method-the-origin-data-has-changed): used to decode html file.

## Issue
* When the width of terminal is too small to fit in the whole progress bar, there will be some display errors.
* When the amount of chapters of novel is too small, `auto` may result in wrongly chosen catalogs.
